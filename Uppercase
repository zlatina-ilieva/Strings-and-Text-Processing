/*
You are given a text. Write a program that changes the text in all regions surrounded by the tags <upcase> and </upcase> to uppercase. 
The tags cannot be nested. Example:
    We are living in a <upcase>yellow submarine</upcase>. We don't have <upcase>anything</upcase> else.

		The expected result:
		We are living in a YELLOW SUBMARINE. We don't have ANYTHING else.
